# drop-for-reddit
A reddit app for the original Samsung Galaxy Watch based on the [Tizen SDK](https://docs.tizen.org/application/web/index).

This project is **unmaintained** (and has been since early 2020), as the author had moved to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, which runs on WearOS instead of Tizen.
