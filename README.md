# drop-for-reddit
A reddit app for the original Samsung Galaxy Watch based on the [Tizen SDK](https://docs.tizen.org/application/web/index) and the [Tizen Advanced UI](https://docs.tizen.org/application/web/guides/tau/tau/) framework, which belong in their entirety to Samsung and have not been changed whatsoever.

This project is **unmaintained**, as the author had moved to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, which runs on WearOS instead of Tizen. As such, no guarentee can be made as to whether the project has not been broken by updates since its last revision in early 2020.
